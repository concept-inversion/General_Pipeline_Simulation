# MIPS-Pipeline-Simulator

This program implement the simple MIPS pipeline, including the following instructions `"lw"`, `"sw"`, `"add"`, `"addi"`, `"sub"`, `"and"`, `"andi"`, `"or"`, `"slt"`, `"bne"`.
In addition to the instructions, it also support detecting and dealing with `"data hazard"`, `"hazard with load"`, and `"branch hazard"`.  Data forwarding has been removed in this version to intentionally cause data hazards which cause delays. The point of this code is to research and experiment with the causes of delays, so hazards are actually desired and important.

Note that in this version, there are some niche issues involving `"bne"` and tracking the cycles that instructions get written back on.  Programs using `"bne"` will not always be simulated perfectly.  However, these issues appear to be confined to instances of `"bne"` being used in very strange ways and normal programming should not be affected much, if at all.
Also note that `"sub"` has been coded to take 3 cycles in the execute stage of the pipeline, as an example of coding an instruction to take more than 1 cycle to execute. 
## Initialize

There are ten registers, and their initial values are as below:

The memory initial value is as below:

Instruction memory starts from 0.

## Input

The program will read the the `input.txt` file from the same root, the content of the file being the 32 bit machine codes.
The  format should look like below.

```
10001101000000010000000000000011  
00000000000000100001100000100000  
00010000000000100000000000000110
```
The corresponding MIPS instructions is:
```shell
lw $1, 0x03($8)  
add $3, $0, $2  
beq $0, $2, 0x06 #(branch PC+4+4Ã—6)   
```

## Output

Originally, after executing the program, it would simulate every pipeline register's value on each clock cycle and save the record as a `.txt` file named `Result`.  This output has been replaced (the code is simply commented out should a user want it for debugging or other purposes; the register values are still simulated).  Now it outputs the following data for each instruction: `Cycle Fetched,Cycle Written Back,OP Code,Destination Register,Source Register1,Source Register2,isStore,isLoad,isBranch,Total Execution Time (Cycle Written Back - Cycle Fetched + 1)` in that format, with -1s denoting a value is not applicable for the instruction (0 is false, 1 is true). An example is included in `Result.txt` on this page.
